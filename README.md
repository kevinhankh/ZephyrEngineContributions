# ZephyrEngineContributions
This repository showcases what I worked on for the Zephyr engine. This is a C++ game engine for a group project in my third semester of the BTech games development program at BCIT (September - December 2017). It was made to create our game project Okeanos. My role for this project was to create the physics and audio engines. This was a very ambitious project with an attempt to utilize a unique multi threaded messaging system. With only 3 months to finish, in conjunction to our other courses, we had to speed up development near the end. We did find inefficient parts in our engine, but overall it was a great experience to have. You can read my experience with this project here https://kevingregoryhan.com/okeanos
