# ZephyrEngineContributions
This repository showcases what I worked on for the Zephyr engine. This is part of a C++ game engine for a game project in my third semester of the BTech games development program at BCIT (September - December 2017). In our group of 7, my role for the engine was to create the physics and audio systems. I was also in charge of creating audio assets for the game. Having only 3 months to complete this in conjunction with our other courses, this was a very ambitious project as we attempt to utilize a unique multi-threaded messaging system. Despite having inefficient parts in our engine, we were surprised at how much we accomplished. Overall it was a great learning experience.
